# Test Automation Framework


Project Name: Test Automation Framework

🖥 Language: C#

🧪 Testing Approach: BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

🎯 Purpose:

A robust and maintainable test automation framework designed to support Behavior-Driven Development using Cucumber syntax via SpecFlow alternatives, given SpecFlow is no longer actively maintained. 
This framework enables seamless collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders by using human-readable feature files to define system behavior.

🧱 Core Features:

BDD-style test automation using Gherkin syntax

Page Object Model (POM) for scalable and maintainable UI tests

Cross-browser support with automatic driver management

NUnit for test execution and reporting

📦 NuGet Packages Used:

NUnit – Test framework for structuring and executing tests

WebDriverManager – Automatically manages browser driver binaries

Selenium.WebDriver – Core library for browser automation

Selenium.Support – Provides additional support for advanced WebDriver capabilities
