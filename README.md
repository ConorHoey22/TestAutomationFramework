# Test Automation Framework


Project Name: Test Automation Framework

ðŸ–¥ Language: C#

ðŸ§ª Testing Approach: BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

A robust and maintainable test automation framework designed to support Behavior-Driven Development using Cucumber syntax via SpecFlow alternatives, given SpecFlow is no longer actively maintained. 
This framework enables seamless collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders by using human-readable feature files to define system behavior.

ðŸ§± Core Features:

BDD-style test automation using Gherkin syntax

Page Object Model (POM) for scalable and maintainable UI tests

Cross-browser support with automatic driver management

NUnit for test execution and reporting

ðŸ“¦ NuGet Packages Used:

NUnit â€“ Test framework for structuring and executing tests

WebDriverManager â€“ Automatically manages browser driver binaries

Selenium.WebDriver â€“ Core library for browser automation

Selenium.Support â€“ Provides additional support for advanced WebDriver capabilities

AventStack.ExtentReports - Generates HTML Reporting 

Reqnroll - open-source .NET BDD framework
Reqnroll is an open-source Cucumber-style BDD test automation framework for .NET. It has been created as a reboot of the SpecFlow project.
